## Hi there 👋 

I'm Lance.
I’m an **AI Product Manager at MOE (Singapore)** shipping GenAI products for teaching & learning, with a focus on **evaluation, safety, and adoption**.
Nice to e-meet you!

### 🏗️ What I do
At MOE, I work across product, data, design, and engineering to ship classroom-facing AI features end-to-end:

- 🚢 Shipped **4 GenAI features** on a nationwide platform serving **500,000+ users**
- 📈 Drove adoption to ~**100k monthly active users** through workshops for power users and stakeholders
- ⚙️ Operationalised prompts in production (version control, regression checks, model/provider evaluations)
- 🧪 Built LLM evaluation & safety: two-layer framework (commercial safety + education-specific harms), adversarial testing, and guardrails
- 🌏 Built across **4 languages** (English, Malay, Chinese, Tamil) and **20+ subjects** while maintaining accuracy

---

### 🔭 What I’m wrestling with for 2026
- ❓ How do we measure “learning gains” fairly when teachers start from different places?
- ❓ How do we support educators to build confidence and capability—without adding workload?
